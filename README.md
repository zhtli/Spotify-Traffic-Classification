# Spotify Traffic Classification
In this project we analyze and classify Spotify encrypted traffic to try to recognize characteristics of the content being streamed. We trained ML model to learn Spotify's streaming pattern and classify it in different categories, e.g. Music or Podcast, or the audio quality setting.

## Data Capture Process
Inside the folder `spotify_data_capture_process` you will find the script used to capture data from an interface while running spotify. This was also used as a baseline for the classifiers to capture specific data to train and test models.
